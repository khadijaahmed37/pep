  <p>I am a student at <a href="https://www.tcdsb.org/schools/stjoanofarc/Pages/default.aspx">St. Joan of Arc Catholic Academy.</a> My first year back to school was last year and even after skipping four years of school, I passed Grade Nine with a
    90+ average. I skipped four years of school because I was doing hifz, and I finally completed hifz on Jan 12, 2018. I am turning fifteen in twenty-five days. I might get a cat for my birthday and I'm super excited. I've been asking for a cat
    since I was six, and now I might actually get one. Finally. My favorite thing to do is read; I read at least three books a week. I started a web development course to pass the time in quarantine and it's actually pretty fun. It feels good to
    actually learn something after just wasting time for four months.</p>
